# sem-survey

This survey is a test for participants to identify if the images are colourized using our model or human beings. 

The analysis is for our base project https://github.com/isrugeek/semcolour and the paper titled "Nanoscale Microscopy Images Colourization Using Neural Networks"

This code is based on the orginal author of this code at https://github.com/jrue/JavaScript-Quiz
